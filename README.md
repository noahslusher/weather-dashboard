# weather-dashboard

## I will build a weather dashboard so travelers can plan a trip accordingly

## It needs:
1. A search bar for cities
2. When a city is searched the user is presented with current and future conditions and the city is added to search history
3. When current weather conditions are viewed the user is presented with city name, the date, and an icon representation of weather conditiosn, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed
4. When the UV index is viewed there is an associated color wit hthe conditions
5. The future weather conditions show a five day forecast that displays the date, icon representation ofweather conditions, the temperature, the wind, speeed, and the humidity.
6. When a city is clicked on from the search history, then the conditions are shown again.
